# Guidelines for Pair Programming

1 Driver

1+ Navigators

If driving: work on code that isn't yours

Your workflow:
  - Driver forks the navigator's repo
  - Driver clones their forked repo to their computer
  - Driver starts new branch
  - Navigator dictates code to write and driver writes it on their computer
  - When finished: driver pushes new branch to their forked repo
  - Driver opens a pull request to navigator's main repo
  - If navigator approves, merge the pull request
  - Switch
